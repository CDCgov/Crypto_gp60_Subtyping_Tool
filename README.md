# Cryptosporidium GP60 Characterization Tool


### Tool Functionality and Overview

This tool's intended purpose is to perform Cryptosporidium subtyping utilizing the GP60 genomic target region within the Cryptosporidum genome. The region targets the subtype family, short tandem repeats and secondary repeats within the sequece. The tool works with Sanger sequences and isolate whole genome contig sequences in fasta format.

## Building Container

To rebuild the container, clone this repository and run the command below:
`docker build -tag(optional) -file Dockerfile <location>`

## Requirements:
- Linux Operating system 
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) 
- Perl

## Expected Input:
- --fasta		Fasta file with 1 or more sanger sequences OR a fasta file containing the assembly of 1 samples
- --blastdb	Prebuilt curated blast database
- --data		Data type can be sanger or wgs (capitalization does not matter)

## Expected Output: 
Generates the gp60 subtyping results in a tab delimited text format

### Running with Docker
``` docker run -v $(pwd)/SM_TestData:/test --privileged wdpbcdsphl/crypto_gp60:2.4 perl /scripts/gp60Typer.pl --blastdb db/Crypto_GP60_DB --fasta /test/testInput_SM.fasta --data sanger > results_gp60SM-15.txt ```


### Running with Singularity
```singularity exec -B $(pwd)/SM_TestData:/dataIn crypto_gp60-2.4.simg perl /scripts/gp60Typer.pl --blastdb /db/Crypto_GP60_DB --fasta /dataIn/gp60_seqs.fasta --data sanger```
